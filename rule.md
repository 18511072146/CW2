**How to start the game and how to control it?**

You need to open a file called start. exe in the CSGAME folder, and then you can Start the game.

Description: This game for the Internet game, set a maximum of 10 players, forced to kick out after death.

The executable file is Start.exe. Click to open it

You can hold down Alt+Tab to view the game loading process on the console.

Operation: W, S, A, D walk

Left mouse button shooting (all characters are enemies)

Esc key to exit the game (do not close the console window, it will malfunction)

Problem: A white screen will appear when opened (because it takes time to load the pistol model), just wait 15s! Just wait 15 seconds! Just wait 15 seconds!

If you can not move in the input method may be affected, press shift.

If you can't see anyone else, it's because you're the only one on the server

**How does the code work?**

C++ is used to write the logic and control flow of the game, and OpenGL is used to render the graphics of the game, so my c++ code has some annotated code and there are some functions here to control the actions of the game character, such as shooting or feedback from being killed, to make the player more interactive. opengl mainly gives a great help for the modeling of maps and characters.

**Special place**

I think the biggest feature of this game is that you can have a server and instead of fighting a bunch of robots, fighting real people is more exciting. I started the work the day after the teacher passed the topic I selected. It took me about half a month to finish the work successively. Besides, I looked up relevant materials on the Internet, reviewed c++ language and learned how to configure opengl in VS to achieve the combination of c++ and opengl.
